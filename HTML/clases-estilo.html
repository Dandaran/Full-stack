        <h1>Hitchin' a ride</h1>
            <p>Hey mister, where are you headed?<br>
            Are you in a hurry?<br>
            Need a lift to happy hour? Say, "Oh no"<br>
            <br>
            Do you brake for distilled spirits?<br>
            I need a break as well <br>
            The well that inebriates the guilt <br>
            One, two, one, two, three, four <br>
            <br>
            Cold turkey's getting stale <br>
            Tonight, I'm eating crow <br>
            Fermented salmonella, poison oak, no <br>
            <br>
            There's a drought at the fountain of youth <br>
            And now I'm dehydrating <br>
            My tongue is swelling up <br>
            I say, "One, two, one, two, three, four" <br>
            <br>
            Troubled times <br>
            You know I cannot lie <br>
            I'm off the wagon, and I'm hitchin' a ride <br>
            <br>
