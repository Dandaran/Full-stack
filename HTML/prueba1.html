  <div><p>Hey mister, where are you headed?<br>
    Are you in a hurry?<br>
    Need a lift to happy hour? Say, "Oh no"<br>
    <br>
    Do you brake for distilled spirits?<br>
    I need a break as well <br>
    The well that inebriates the guilt <br>
    One, two, one, two, three, four <br>
    <br>
    Cold turkey's getting stale <br>
    Tonight, I'm eating crow <br>
    Fermented salmonella, poison oak, no <br>
    <br>
    There's a drought at the fountain of youth <br>
    And now I'm dehydrating <br>
    My tongue is swelling up <br>
    I say, "One, two, one, two, three, four" <br>
    <br>
    Troubled times <br>
    You know I cannot lie <br>
    I'm off the wagon, and I'm hitchin' a ride <br>
    <br>
    There's a drought at the fountain of youth <br>
    And now I'm dehydrating <br>
    My tongue is swelling up, I say... <br>
    <br>
    "Shit!" <br>
    <br>
    Troubled times <br>
    You know I cannot lie <br>
    I'm off the wagon, and I'm hitchin' a ride <br>
    hitchin' a ride <br>
    <br>
    (Don't know where to go) hitchin' a ride <br>
    (Don't know where to go) hitchin' a ride <br>
    (Don't know where to go) hitchin' a ride <br>
    (Don't know where to go) hitchin' a ride <br>
    (Don't know where to go) hitchin' a ride <br>
    (Don't know where to go) hitchin' a ride <br>
