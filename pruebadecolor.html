    <p>Hey mister, where are you headed?<br>
        Are you in a hurry?<br>
        Need a lift to happy hour? Say, "Oh no"<br>
        <br>
        Do you brake for distilled spirits?<br>
        I need a break as well <br>
        The well that inebriates the guilt <br>
        One, two, one, two, three, four <br>
        <br>
        Cold turkey's getting stale <br>
        Tonight, I'm eating crow <br>
        Fermented salmonella, poison oak, no <br>
        <br>
        There's a drought at the fountain of youth <br>
        And now I'm dehydrating <br>
        My tongue is swelling up <br>
        I say, "One, two, one, two, three, four" <br>
        <br>
        Troubled times <br>
        You know I cannot lie <br>
        I'm off the wagon, and I'm hitchin' a ride <br>
        <br>
        There's a drought at the fountain of youth <br>
        And now I'm dehydrating <br>
        My tongue is swelling up, I say... <br>
        <br>
        "Shit!" <br>
        <br>
        Troubled times <br>
        You know I cannot lie <br>
        I'm off the wagon, and I'm hitchin' a ride <br>
        hitchin' a ride <br>
        <br>
        (Don't know where to go) hitchin' a ride <br>
        (Don't know where to go) hitchin' a ride <br>
        (Don't know where to go) hitchin' a ride <br>
        (Don't know where to go) hitchin' a ride <br>
        (Don't know where to go) hitchin' a ride <br>
